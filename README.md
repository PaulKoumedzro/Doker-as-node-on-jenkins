Setup docker as node or slave is proven to  save cost and also increase the efficiency.
In order to  create container as node, you first need to install Docker and jenkins on the same machine and then follow the steps in the setup-node.txt.
Once you setup the node, you don't have to worry about generating keys to connect them since they are on the same machine. You can simply setup your node and build your job.
